The Child Well-Being Data Portal is a joint project of the Center for Social Sector Analytics and Technology (CSSAT) and Partners for Our Children (POC) that promotes an understanding of the child welfare system by providing detailed, customizable data about children and families served in Washington State and beyond. Incorporating a collection of interactive data visualization tools, its goal is to put information in to the hands of social workers, parents, advocates, and policy-makers, to help improve the lives of vulnerable children and families touched by the child welfare system.

The data for these visualization tools comes from multiple source, most notably from Washington state’s Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF.) Through a partnership with DCYF, we have access to quarterly deidentified data extracts from FamLink, the case management information system adopted in 2009. Additional data sources include the US Census Bureau, Washington’s Office of Financial Management, the National Data Archive of Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN), and others as indicated.

If you publish data from the Portal, please cite CSSAT and POC and link to the Data Portal, where appropriate. We also recommend reading the Info page for the measure(s) to gain a clear understanding of all details related to the data.
