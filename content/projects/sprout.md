Sprout is a web-based application designed to help providers of child welfare services to streamline time-consuming business processes including tracking types and frequency of services rendered.

The Sprout platform gives providers an intuitive way to request services for clients and to record delivered services. The data collected in Sprout increases our understanding of the relationship between effective service delivery and desired client outcomes. The application brings the ease of an e-commerce online ordering system to the social service sector. Sprout allows the state social worker to schedule visitation services for a child welfare client online and receive the visitation updates and reports as soon as they are entered by the provider.

The goal of Sprout is to streamline the data entry process and put actionable data into the hands of the people who need it. It can be used across all social services to provide a more holistic picture of the clients they collectively serve and to improve the overall service array.
