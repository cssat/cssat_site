      <description>The Child Well-Being Data Portal is a joint project of the Center for Social Sector Analytics and Technology (CSSAT) and Partners for Our Children (POC) that promotes an understanding of the child welfare system by providing detailed, customizable data about children and families served in Washington State and beyond. Incorporating a collection of interactive data visualization tools, its goal is to put information in to the hands of social workers, parents, advocates, and policy-makers, to help improve the lives of vulnerable children and families touched by the child welfare system.</description>

      <description>Oliver is a web-based application designed to help providers of child welfare services to streamline time-consuming business processes including tracking types and frequency of services rendered.
The Oliver platform gives providers an intuitive way to request services for clients and to record delivered services. The data collected in Oliver increases our understanding of the relationship between effective service delivery and desired client outcomes. The application brings the ease of an e-commerce online ordering system to the social service sector.</description>
