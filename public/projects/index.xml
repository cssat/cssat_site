      <description>In chess, every move has a purpose. Social service case management obviously cannot be be undertaken with this much unceasing calculation, nor should we want to practice in this way, but the arc of a case should generally align with a predetermined strategy.
The analytical case management (ACM) curriculum is designed to help social workers use data in the context of law and policy to develop such a strategy.
The ACM curriculum is the result of nearly two decades of social work practice and research on the part of the curriculum&amp;rsquo;s author, Joe Mienko.</description>

      <description>The Dependent Child Legal Representation Evaluation is an attempt to understand whether or not legal representation would benefit children in dependency proceedings (court hearings to determine if and when a child who has been removed from a parent or guardianâ€™s care will return.) The study is being conducted in four Washington counties, two of which are piloting a legislatively mandated and funded program that provides trained attorneys for each child in a dependency case.</description>
